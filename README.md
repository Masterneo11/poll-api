# poll-api
The online poll will ask 5-10 different questions and have useres submit there responses 
A few questions would be open-ended, a few would be multiple-choice. The user would get to see there responses along with the collective results from everyone who participates.
The user would also insert three questions about themselves 
All the responses would be divided up into 4 different categories in which every user would see which is the most and least popular/ common category
